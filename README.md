# EthTrust-public

This repository is to enable public comment on the [EEA EthTrust Security Levels Specification](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html)
and other work of the [EthTrust Security Levels Working Group](https://entethalliance.org/groups/EthTrust).

Comments should be made by adding a comment to an [open issue](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/EthTrust-public/issues) if there is a relevant issue already, or by creating a 
[new issue](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/EthTrust-public/issues/new/choose). If proposals are editorial in nature (i.e. they clarify wording, fix spelling mistakes or obvious logic errors),
the process is fairly straightforward. If a proposal suggests a substantive change - e.g. adding a new requirement, or changing a requirement so it will be tested differently, 
through the issue template we request the commenter to complete the [EEA Non-member participation agreement](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/EthTrust-public/blob/main/EEA-Non-Member-Participation-Agreement.pdf). Essentially this is an agreement not to introduce material covered by a "submarine patent",
and to respect any confidential information provided by the group, although that will usually be minimal or none.

The Working Group will consider the issues raised, reply in the public issue as they make progress or request clarification, and explain their resolution and the outcome of each issue.
The group **MAY** invite individuals who have raised issues to participate in a dicussion. Any member of EEA is automatically entitled to participate in the Working Group.
